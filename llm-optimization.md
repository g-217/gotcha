### The interview is for a Machine Learning Engineer role at Meta, focusing on optimizing LLM deployments.

**Interviewer:** "We're seeing incredible adoption of our new internal LLM-powered assistant, but inference costs are spiraling. How would you approach optimizing the inference pipeline for a model like Llama 3 8B, handling thousands of requests per second?"

**You pause...**
This isn't just about throwing more GPUs at the problem. It's about a holistic strategy for cost-efficiency and performance at scale.

**You:** "Optimizing LLM inference at this scale requires a multi-faceted approach, touching on model efficiency, serving infrastructure, and request batching."

**Interviewer:** "Walk me through your key strategies."

**You:**
"Let's break down the core areas for optimization:"
 - **Model Compression**: Reducing model size and computational requirements.
 - **Quantization**: Lowering precision (e.g., FP16 to INT8) to reduce memory footprint and increase throughput.
 - **Distillation**: Creating a smaller, faster student model that mimics a larger teacher model.
 - **Efficient Serving Frameworks**: Utilizing specialized libraries and runtimes.
 - **Batching Strategies**: Grouping requests to maximize GPU utilization.
 - **Hardware Acceleration**: Leveraging specialized chips and optimized drivers.

**You (on serving frameworks):**
"For a model like Llama 3 8B, I'd strongly consider frameworks like vLLM or TensorRT-LLM."
 - **vLLM**: Known for its PagedAttention mechanism, which significantly improves throughput by managing KV cache efficiently, especially with varying sequence lengths. It's great for dynamic batching.
 - **TensorRT-LLM**: NVIDIA's high-performance inference runtime. It provides highly optimized kernels for specific NVIDIA GPUs, often yielding the best raw performance. Requires more fine-tuning and can be more hardware-specific.

**You (on batching and caching):** 
"Beyond the framework, dynamic batching is crucial. With vLLM, this is well-handled. Furthermore, implementing speculative decoding or caching common prompts/responses can dramatically reduce latency and computation for repeated queries."

**Interviewer:** "If you had to prioritize, where would you start to get the quickest wins?"

**You:**
"I'd start with quantization (e.g., to INT8 or even INT4 if quality allows) combined with an efficient serving framework like vLLM. These two often deliver the most significant immediate gains in throughput and cost reduction without requiring a full model retraining. Once those are stable, we can explore more advanced techniques like distillation or custom kernel optimization."

**Interviewer:** Nods!
